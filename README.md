1. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) 

1. Fork the IITP-Connect project ([why and how to fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))

1. Clone your fork of the project locally. At the command line:

        git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/IITP-Connect

 If you prefer not to use the command line, you can use Android Studio to create a new project from version control using `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/IITP-Connect`.
